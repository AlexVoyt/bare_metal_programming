# What is this
This is a collection of my projects that run on bare metal, without operating system support. Currently there is only one
(my take on [OSdev bare bones tutorial]("https://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_Bones"), you can find details in `my_bare_bones` directory).
However, later I planning to add some other things that I find interesting, such as microarch benchmarks, CPU vulnerabilities or UEFI programming.
